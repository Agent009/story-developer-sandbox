# Story Playground

This is a Next.js app built to help you learn the Story Protocol TypeScript SDK and see its integration with a wallet like Metamask.

The playground will walk you through building with Story Protocol step-by-step. More specifically:

1. Registering an IP Asset
2. Attaching terms to that IP Asset
3. Minting a License Token from an IP Asset
4. Registering a derivative IP Asset from a License Token

## Get Started

1. `npm install` in the root directory
2. `npm run dev` in the root directory
